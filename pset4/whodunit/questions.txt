1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library
section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs
that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable
values for each type, using macros .

2.  These specify the number of bits for each typdef. uint8_t is the same as a byte and is
shorthand for "a type of unsigned integer of length 8 bits."

uint8_t = unsigned char = BYTE
uint16_t = unsight short = DWORD
uint32_t = unsigned int = LONG
uint64_t = unsigned long long = WORD

3.

uint8_t = unsigned char = BYTE = 1 byte
uint16_t = unsight short = DWORD = 2 bytes
uint32_t = unsigned int = LONG = 4 bytes
uint64_t = unsigned long long = WORD = 8 bytes

4.

ASCII = BM
Decimal = 66 77
Hexadecimal = 0x42 0x4d

5.

bfSize = The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
biSize = The number of bytes required by the structure.

6.

biHeight = The height of the bitmap, in pixels.
If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB and its origin is the
lower-left corner.
If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the
upper-left corner.

7.

biBitCount = The number of bits-per-pixel. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER
structure determines the number of bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of
colors in the bitmap. This member must be one of the following values.

8.

fopen may return NULL on line 24 if the file couldn't be opened (e.g. doesn't exist).
fopen may return NULL on line 32 if the file couldn't be created (e.g. no write permissions).

9.

The third argument to fread is how many blocks, or times, to read the file. 1 means to read
the file 1 time.

11.

Allows you to move the position of the cursor in the file and resume operations at new location

12.

If you want to change the location of the pointer from its current location, use SEEK_CUR
